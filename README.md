# Prep work
Once you are comfortable with the data structures & algorithms above, do the following exercise multiple times (at least 2–3 times) until you can do them with your eyes closed.

* Implement an ArrayList from scratch
* Reverse a linked list
* Implement a Stack & a Queue using Array
* Implement a HashTable with simple Hashing functions
* Implement a Graph using Adjacency List, and then write functions for BFS & DFS.
* Write the binary search algorithm both recursively and iteratively
* Write the merge sort algorithm
* Write the quicksort algorithm
* Print binary tree using DFS (in-order, preorder and post order — all three of them) and BFS.
* Memorize time & space complexities for common algorithms. Here’s an [interesting website](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/).
* Implement a trie.
* Learn these important bit manipulation tricks.
